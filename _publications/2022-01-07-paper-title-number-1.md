The Chinese edible vegetable oil supply is insufficient and overdependent on excessive imports, increasing market risks. Residents also suffer from an increasing risk of obesity in recent years. This essay utilized the relevant data on Chinese edible vegetable oil consumption from 1965 to 2020 to analyze the changes and the risks in the consumer demand side and supply side of edible vegetable oil through SPSS, demonstrating the correlation between overconsumption of edible vegetable oil and consumer health is negative. Due to the strategic requirements of “Healthy China”, the supply policy should focus on increasing paddy field rapeseed planting area and limiting edible oil daily intake to optimize the demand and supply side reform of Chinese edible vegetable oil consumption.
